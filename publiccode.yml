    shortDescription: >
      A fast and extensible REST API service that parses EDIFACT message text inputs or files and returns structured JSON output.
    longDescription: >
      EDIParse is a lightweight and extensible REST API service that parses EDIFACT message text inputs or files
      (e.g. APERAK, MSCONS, etc.) and returns structured JSON output. Built with Python and Pydantic, the service offers type-safe,
      high-performance parsing for energy and logistics data exchange formats.
      
      The service follows a clean hexagonal architecture pattern with a clear separation between the application and domain layers.
      It is designed to be easily extensible to support additional EDIFACT message types beyond the currently supported MSCONS and APERAK formats.
      
      EDIParse is containerized and can be deployed using Docker, making it easy to integrate into existing microservices and ETL pipelines.
      The API is implemented using FastAPI, providing automatic documentation and validation.
      
      The parser uses a factory pattern to handle different segment types and message types, with each segment type having its own converter
      and handler. This modular design allows for easy extension and maintenance of the codebase.
      
      The project includes comprehensive documentation, including architecture documentation, parsing process documentation for different
      message types, and API generation documentation.
    features:
    - Currently, supports EDIFACT message types of MSCONS, APERAK
    - Converts raw EDIFACT into clean, nested JSON structures
    - Fully extensible architecture using clean and hexagonal architecture concept
    - FastAPI-powered REST endpoints
    - Pydantic v2 for modern data validation and serialization
    - Easy integration into existing microservices and ETL pipelines
